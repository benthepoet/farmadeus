<p>Planted Green Beauty peas today. Cherry trees are getting close to leafing out, the Juliet 
Cherries are the furthest along. I expect them to be the most vigorous growers in the food 
forest this year.</p>
<hr>
<h3>April 2, 2020</h3>
<p>I noticed today that it looks like all the Turkish Rocket seedlings from last year have already 
started coming up.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-04-02-00.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I've determined that Scarlet Kale is the most hardy variety of kale we've ever grown. The plants 
from last year are already beginning to send out side shoots. Unlike the Thousand-Headed Kale, the stalks 
of the Scarlet Kale survived the winter without hardly being scathed.</p>
<hr>
<h3>March 31, 2020</h3>
<p>The Victoria Rhubarb the I planted last year is already starting to emerge.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-31-00.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<hr>
<h3>March 29, 2020</h3>
<p>Replaced an old fence post that's about 4 - 5 years old. Lasted a good while considering 
it's aspen and I didn't protect the bottom part of the post. The new post is red oak. I wrapped 
black plastic around the base to keep the soil from making contact with wood at ground level. That's 
the area where rot usually occurs.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-29-00.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Was able to locate the other 2 Caucasian Mountain Spinach seedlings. It looks like the Sea Kale seedlings 
from last year survived. I found one that a fairly decent root developed and moved it into the corner of my 
main asparagus bed.</p>
<p>Dug out a large Comfrey plant from the bed where I usually grow peas. Broke the root apart and planted in various 
areas.</p>
<hr>
<h3>March 28, 2020</h3>
<p>Planted the 2 remaining Buartblack Walnut seedlings at the top of the hill. Moved a Chickasaw Plum 
seedling so that it'll be a shrub layer in front of the Buartblack Walnut.</p>
<p>Looking down from the upper part of the hill.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-28-00.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Shredded leaves to place on top of the second potato bed.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-28-01.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The Music Garlic has started poking through the mulch.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-28-02.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<hr>
<h3>March 27, 2020</h3>
<p>Spread manure on our second potato bed today. Also shredded a load of leaves and placed that on 
top of the manure layer.</p>
<p>Last fall I originally transplanted 4 Buartblack Walnut seedlings at the bottom of our 
sloping hill. I believe I made a mistake in doing this, as it may create too much shade 
on the hill and prevent us from successfully growing crops there. With that in mind I moved 
2 of the seedlings up the hill to establish a canopy as far back as I can. The initial tree/shrub 
layer in front of the Buartblack Walnut will consist of Americana Dunbars Plum and Chickasaw Plum.</p>
<p>The two cages in the back of this photo are the Buartblack Walnut seedlings.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-27-00.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Last summer I planted out 3 Caucasian Mountain Spinach (<em>Hablitzia Tamnoides</em>) seedlings. Two 
I haven't seen any sign from yet, but my strongest seedling is already re-emerging and sending out 
new shoots. It'll be nice to have a perennial spinach-like green without the fuss of starting 
seeds every year.</p>

<h3>March 25, 2020</h3>
<p>Hauled the first load of manure out of the chicken run and laid on top of a bed 
where we will be growing potatoes and beans this year. I've never companion planted 
anything with potatoes but I've noticed that bush/pole beans work as a great companion 
for just about any plant. I routinely plant beans in between my tomatoes. This fixes nitrogen in the soil 
and the beans also serve as a living mulch, keeping the soil beneath cool and free of weeds.</p>
<p>My quick air prune bed design from the fall has experienced a failure. I didn't secure 
the hardware cloth on the bottom using wooden rails and thus the staples failed and the 
hardware cloth is now sagging. One bed I lost a good bit of bottom material from but both 
beds are still intact, they just likely won't have the intended air prune effect.</p>
<p>Started raking leaves to use for mulch, winter onset so quickly last year that most of<br>
the leaves are still on the ground. We will shred the leaves using our wood chipper and then 
lay them on garden beds that aren't fully covered.</p>
<p>The Music Garlic we have planted is beginning to poke through the mulch, also noticed a couple of our 
Rhubarb plants are getting ready to push out leaves. I checked on the Elephant Garlic corms we planted 
in the fall and so far I haven't seen any signs of rooting, though it did look like the hard shell on 
the corms have split.</p>
<p>The Thousand-Headed Kale and Scarlet Kale appears to have overwintered well. Scarlet Kale stalks have mostly 
retained their color and firmness as they're the hardier variety. The stalks of the Thousand-Headed Kale are bleached white. 
I imagine for those most of the stalk is probably dead, though the plants should still send out new shoots from 
the base if that's the case.</p>
<hr>
<h3>March 22, 2020</h3>
<p>Started seeds today for Skirret and St. John's Wort.</p>
<p>Pulled seed potatoes out of the 5-gallon bucket root cellar. Potatoes are in good condition, 
don't see any that were compromised by mold or rot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-22-01.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<hr>
<h3>March 20, 2020</h3>
<p>Started seeds today for Abe Lincoln Tomato, Black Krim Tomato, Black Vernissage Tomato, Chadwick's Cherry Tomato, 
Pink Bumblebee Tomato, Tadorna Leek, and Lovage.</p>
<p>Planted some Russian Tarragon seeds in a can.</p>
<hr>
<h3>March 16, 2020</h3>
<p>Salvaged 12 cuttings from the Methley Plum and planted in a container to see if they'll root. 
Only about 5 - 6 are good hardwood cuttings so realistically I'm expecting to get maybe 2 or 3 successful plants.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-16-00.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I cut the lower ends of the cuttings at a 45 degree angle to increase the surface area. The ends were then dipped 
in rooting hormone and placed into potting mix. Placed a ziplock bag over the cuttings to maintain a high humidity level.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-16-01.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<hr>
<h3>March 15, 2020</h3>
<p>Placed Arctic Beauty Kiwi (<em>Actinidia kolomikta</em>) seeds in the refrigerator for stratification.</p>
<p>Checked on the food forest and several trees were damaged by voles over the winter.</p>
<p>The Methley Plum has been completely girdled. The best thing I can do is try and root as many cuttings 
as I can get off the tree.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-15-00.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The Northern Prairie Apricot was completely debarked. This plant still has a good root system and 
has regrown vigorously after being cut down by deer a couple years ago.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-15-01.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The Bartlett Pear, Superior Plum and the Toka Plum were also damaged but I believe these trees may be able 
to heal and survive.</p>
<hr>
<h3>March 7, 2020</h3>
<p>Placed 27 Hybrid Siberian Crabapple (<em>Malus robusta</em>) seeds in the refrigerator for 
stratification. Based on research this variety is a cross between Siberian Crabapple (<em>Malus baccata</em>) 
and Plumleaf Crabapple (<em>Malus prunifolia</em>). One source says the common name is Cherry Crabapple, that's 
what I'll likely refer to it as going forward.</p>
<p>Progress on the can with Antonovka Apple and Siberian Crabapple.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-07-00.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Progress on the can with Siberian Crabapple, there's five seedlings but one looks like it may not make it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-07-01.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<hr>
<h3>March 5, 2020</h3>
<p>Blue Hyssop seeds have started sprouting. Placed 30 Sargent Crabapple and 10 Spice Bush 
seeds in the refrigerator for stratification.</p>
<hr>
<h3>February 28, 2020</h3>
<p>Planted around 10 Blue Hyssop seeds in a can.</p>
<hr>
<h3>February 24, 2020</h3>
<p>Placed 15 Winter Gold Crabapple seeds in the refrigerator for stratification.</p>
<hr>
<h3>February 23, 2020</h3>
<p>Placed Seaberry and Lingonberry seeds in the refrigerator for stratification. The first 
two Dunstan Chestnut seedlings are starting to leaf out.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-02-23-00.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The Siberian Crabapple seedlings have started sending out their first true leaves.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-02-23-01.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<hr>
<h3>February 16, 2020</h3>
<p>Removed the remaining 5 Antonovka Apple and 6 Siberian Crabapple seeds from the refrigerator 
and planted in a can.</p>
<hr>
<h3>February 15, 2020</h3>
<p>Removed the remaining 9 Dunstan Chestnut seeds from the refrigerator and planted in 
cups.
<img src="/images/farm-log-2020-02-15-00.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Placed 10 American Persimmon and 29 Americana Dunbars Plum seeds in the refrigerator for 
stratification.</p>
<hr>
<h3>February 11, 2020</h3>
<p>Siberian Crabapple seedlings have started emerging.
<img src="/images/farm-log-2020-02-11-00.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Removed five Antonovka Apple seeds from refrigerator and planted in a can. Placed 50 Hardy Kiwi, 25 Juneberry, 
and 25 Saskatoon seeds in the refrigerator for stratification.</p>
<hr>
<h3>February 8, 2020</h3>
<p>Checked on the apple seeds in the refrigerator. Planted five Siberian Crabapple seeds that had sprouted.</p>
<hr>
<h3>January 26, 2020</h3>
<p>The Dunstan Chestnuts have begun to sprout in the refrigerator. One was compromised by mold. Pulled 
two out and planted in containers.</p>
<hr>
<h3>January 11, 2020</h3>
<p>The hens have started laying. Collected three medium light-brown eggs today. I'm guessing 
they're from the Golden Laced Wyandotte hens as I've read Welsummer eggs tend to be speckled.

<p>Looking at introducing a couple more plants in the new year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Burdock</li>
<li>St. John's Wort</li>
<li>Stinging Nettle</li>
</ul>
<p>I recall seeing a large-leaved plant back in our forest at one point that I now believe 
may be Burdock. Will verify in the spring/summer if we already have …</p>
