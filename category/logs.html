<p>Placed Arctic Beauty Kiwi (<em>Actinidia kolomikta</em>) seeds in the refrigerator for stratification.</p>
<p>Checked on the food forest and several trees were damaged by voles over the winter.</p>
<p>The Methley Plum has been completely girdled. The best thing I can do is try and root as many cuttings 
as I can get off the tree.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-15-00.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The Northern Prairie Apricot was completely debarked. This plant still has a good root system and 
has regrown vigorously after being cut down by deer a couple years ago.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-15-01.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The Bartlett Pear, Superior Plum and the Toka Plum were also damaged but I believe these trees may be able 
to heal and survive.</p>

<h3>March 7, 2020</h3>
<p>Placed 27 Hybrid Siberian Crabapple (<em>Malus robusta</em>) seeds in the refrigerator for 
stratification. Based on research this variety is a cross between Siberian Crabapple (<em>Malus baccata</em>) 
and Plumleaf Crabapple (<em>Malus prunifolia</em>). One source says the common name is Cherry Crabapple, that's 
what I'll likely refer to it as going forward.</p>
<p>Progress on the can with Antonovka Apple and Siberian Crabapple.</p>
<p><img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-07-00.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Progress on the can with Siberian Crabapple, there's five seedlings but one looks like it may not make it.</p>

two out and planted in containers.</p>
<hr>
<h3>January 11, 2020</h3>
<p>The hens have started laying. Collected three medium light-brown eggs today. I'm guessing 
they're from the Golden Laced Wyandotte hens as I've read Welsummer eggs tend to be speckled.

<p>Looking at introducing a couple more plants in the new year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Burdock</li>
<li>St. John's Wort</li>
<li>Stinging Nettle</li>
</ul>
<p>I recall seeing a large-leaved plant back in our forest at one point that I now believe
