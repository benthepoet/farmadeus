### December 18, 2019
Looking at introducing a couple more plants in the new year.

* Burdock
* St. John's Wort
* Stinging Nettle

I recall seeing a large-leaved plant back in our forest at one point that I now believe 
may be Burdock. Will verify in the spring/summer if we already have this vegetable growing wild.
