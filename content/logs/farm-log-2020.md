### March 29, 2020
Replaced an old fence post that's about 4 - 5 years old. Lasted a good while considering 
it's aspen and I didn't protect the bottom part of the post. The new post is red oak. I wrapped 
black plastic around the base to keep the soil from making contact with wood at ground level. That's 
the area where rot usually occurs.

Was able to locate the other 2 Caucasian Mountain Spinach seedlings. It looks like the Sea Kale seedlings 
from last year survived. I found one that a fairly decent root developed and moved it into the corner of my 
main asparagus bed.

Dug out a large Comfrey plant from the bed where I usually grow peas. Broke the root apart and planted in various 
areas.

Planted the 2 remaining Buartblack Walnut seedlings at the top of the hill. Moved a Chickasaw Plum 
seedling so that it'll be a shrub layer in front of the Buartblack Walnut.

Looking down from the upper part of the hill.

Shredded leaves to place on top of the second potato bed.

The Music Garlic has started poking through the mulch.

Spread manure on our second potato bed today. Also shredded a load of leaves and placed that on 
top of the manure layer.

Last fall I originally transplanted 4 Buartblack Walnut seedlings at the bottom of our 
sloping hill. I believe I made a mistake in doing this, as it may create too much shade 
on the hill and prevent us from successfully growing crops there. With that in mind I moved 
2 of the seedlings up the hill to establish a canopy as far back as I can. The initial tree/shrub 
layer in front of the Buartblack Walnut will consist of Americana Dunbars Plum and Chickasaw Plum.

The two cages in the back of this photo are the Buartblack Walnut seedlings.

Last summer I planted out 3 Caucasian Mountain Spinach (*Hablitzia Tamnoides*) seedlings. Two 
I haven't seen any sign from yet, but my strongest seedling is already re-emerging and sending out 
new shoots. It'll be nice to have a perennial spinach-like green without the fuss of starting 
seeds every year.

### March 25, 2020
Hauled the first load of manure out of the chicken run and laid on top of a bed 
where we will be growing potatoes and beans this year. I've never companion planted 
anything with potatoes but I've noticed that bush/pole beans work as a great companion 
for just about any plant. I routinely plant beans in between my tomatoes. This fixes nitrogen in the soil 
and the beans also serve as a living mulch, keeping the soil beneath cool and free of weeds.

My quick air prune bed design from the fall has experienced a failure. I didn't secure 
the hardware cloth on the bottom using wooden rails and thus the staples failed and the 
hardware cloth is now sagging. One bed I lost a good bit of bottom material from but both 
beds are still intact, they just likely won't have the intended air prune effect.

Started raking leaves to use for mulch, winter onset so quickly last year that most of  
the leaves are still on the ground. We will shred the leaves using our wood chipper and then 
lay them on garden beds that aren't fully covered.

The Music Garlic we have planted is beginning to poke through the mulch, also noticed a couple of our 
Rhubarb plants are getting ready to push out leaves. I checked on the Elephant Garlic corms we planted 
in the fall and so far I haven't seen any signs of rooting, though it did look like the hard shell on 
the corms have split.

The Thousand-Headed Kale and Scarlet Kale appears to have overwintered well. Scarlet Kale stalks have mostly 
retained their color and firmness as they're the hardier variety. The stalks of the Thousand-Headed Kale are bleached white. 
I imagine for those most of the stalk is probably dead, though the plants should still send out new shoots from 
the base if that's the case.

### March 22, 2020
Started seeds today for Skirret and St. John's Wort.

Pulled seed potatoes out of the 5-gallon bucket root cellar. Potatoes are in good condition, 
don't see any that were compromised by mold or rot.

### March 20, 2020
Started seeds today for Abe Lincoln Tomato, Black Krim Tomato, Black Vernissage Tomato, Chadwick's Cherry Tomato, 
Pink Bumblebee Tomato, Tadorna Leek, and Lovage.

Planted some Russian Tarragon seeds in a can.

### March 16, 2020
Salvaged 12 cuttings from the Methley Plum and planted in a container to see if they'll root. 
Only about 5 - 6 are good hardwood cuttings so realistically I'm expecting to get maybe 2 or 3 successful plants.

<img src="/images/farm-log-2020-03-16-00.jpg" width="100%" />

I cut the lower ends of the cuttings at a 45 degree angle to increase the surface area. The ends were then dipped 
in rooting hormone and placed into potting mix. Placed a ziplock bag over the cuttings to maintain a high humidity level.

### March 15, 2020
Placed Arctic Beauty Kiwi (*Actinidia kolomikta*) seeds in the refrigerator for stratification.

Checked on the food forest and several trees were damaged by voles over the winter.

The Methley Plum has been completely girdled. The best thing I can do is try and root as many cuttings 
as I can get off the tree.

The Northern Prairie Apricot was completely debarked. This plant still has a good root system and 
has regrown vigorously after being cut down by deer a couple years ago.

The Bartlett Pear, Superior Plum and the Toka Plum were also damaged but I believe these trees may be able 
to heal and survive.

### March 7, 2020
Placed 27 Hybrid Siberian Crabapple (*Malus robusta*) seeds in the refrigerator for 
stratification. Based on research this variety is a cross between Siberian Crabapple (*Malus baccata*) 
and Plumleaf Crabapple (*Malus prunifolia*). One source says the common name is Cherry Crabapple, that's 
what I'll likely refer to it as going forward.

Progress on the can with Antonovka Apple and Siberian Crabapple.

Progress on the can with Siberian Crabapple, there's five seedlings but one looks like it may not make it.

### March 5, 2020
Blue Hyssop seeds have started sprouting. Placed 30 Sargent Crabapple and 10 Spice Bush 
seeds in the refrigerator for stratification.

---

### February 28, 2020
Planted around 10 Blue Hyssop seeds in a can.

---

### February 24, 2020
Placed 15 Winter Gold Crabapple seeds in the refrigerator for stratification.

### February 23, 2020
Placed Seaberry and Lingonberry seeds in the refrigerator for stratification. The first 
two Dunstan Chestnut seedlings are starting to leaf out.

The Siberian Crabapple seedlings have started sending out their first true leaves.

### February 16, 2020
Removed the remaining 5 Antonovka Apple and 6 Siberian Crabapple seeds from the refrigerator 
and planted in a can.

---

### February 15, 2020
Removed the remaining 9 Dunstan Chestnut seeds from the refrigerator and planted in 
cups.
<img src="/images/farm-log-2020-02-15-00.jpg" width="100%" />

Placed 10 American Persimmon and 29 Americana Dunbars Plum seeds in the refrigerator for 
stratification.

---

### February 11, 2020
Siberian Crabapple seedlings have started emerging.
<img src="/images/farm-log-2020-02-11-00.jpg" width="100%" />

Removed five Antonovka Apple seeds from refrigerator and planted in a can. Placed 50 Hardy Kiwi, 25 Juneberry, 
and 25 Saskatoon seeds in the refrigerator for stratification.

---

### February 8, 2020
Checked on the apple seeds in the refrigerator. Planted five Siberian Crabapple seeds that had sprouted.

---

### January 26, 2020
The Dunstan Chestnuts have begun to sprout in the refrigerator. One was compromised by mold. Pulled 
two out and planted in containers.

---

### January 11, 2020
The hens have started laying. Collected three medium light-brown eggs today. I'm guessing 
they're from the Golden Laced Wyandotte hens as I've read Welsummer eggs tend to be speckled.
