### March 20, 2020
Started seeds today for Abe Lincoln Tomato, Black Krim Tomato, Black Vernissage Tomato, Chadwick's Cherry Tomato, 
Pink Bumblebee Tomato, Tadorna Leek, and Lovage.

Planted some Russian Tarragon seeds in a can.

### March 16, 2020
Salvaged 12 cuttings from the Methley Plum and planted in a container to see if they'll root. 
Only about 5 - 6 are good hardwood cuttings so realistically I'm expecting to get maybe 2 or 3 successful plants.

I cut the lower ends of the cuttings at a 45 degree angle to increase the surface area. The ends were then dipped 
in rooting hormone and placed into potting mix. Placed a ziplock bag over the cuttings to maintain a high humidity level.

### March 15, 2020
Placed Arctic Beauty Kiwi (*Actinidia kolomikta*) seeds in the refrigerator for stratification.

Checked on the food forest and several trees were damaged by voles over the winter.

The Methley Plum has been completely girdled. The best thing I can do is try and root as many cuttings 
as I can get off the tree.

The Northern Prairie Apricot was completely debarked. This plant still has a good root system and 
has regrown vigorously after being cut down by deer a couple years ago.

The Bartlett Pear, Superior Plum and the Toka Plum were also damaged but I believe these trees may be able 
to heal and survive.

### March 7, 2020
Placed 27 Hybrid Siberian Crabapple (*Malus robusta*) seeds in the refrigerator for 
stratification. Based on research this variety is a cross between Siberian Crabapple (*Malus baccata*) 
and Plumleaf Crabapple (*Malus prunifolia*). One source says the common name is Cherry Crabapple, that's 
what I'll likely refer to it as going forward.

Progress on the can with Antonovka Apple and Siberian Crabapple.

Progress on the can with Siberian Crabapple, there's five seedlings but one looks like it may not make it.

The Dunstan Chestnuts have begun to sprout in the refrigerator. One was compromised by mold. Pulled

### January 11, 2020
The hens have started laying. Collected three medium light-brown eggs today. I'm guessing 
they're from the Golden Laced Wyandotte hens as I've read Welsummer eggs tend to be speckled.
