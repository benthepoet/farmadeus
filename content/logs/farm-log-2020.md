### March 7, 2020
Placed 27 Hybrid Siberian Crab Apple (*Malus robusta*) in the refrigerator for 
stratification. Based on research this variety is a cross between Siberian Crab Apple (*Malus baccata*) 
and Plumleaf Crab Apple (*Malus prunifolia*). One source says the common name is Cherry Crab Apple, that's 
what I'll likely refer to it as going forward.

The hens have started laying. Collected three medium light-brown eggs today. I'm guessing 
they're from the Golden Laced Wyandotte hens as I've read Welsummer eggs tend to be speckled.
