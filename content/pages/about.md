Welcome to Farmadeus, this blog serves to chronicle my progress and research into developing 
a sustainable forest farm and seedling nursery.

Our farm is a 10-acre plot located in Zone 4b/5a of Northern Michigan. The majority of the land 
is forested with a variety of aspen, pine, maple, and ironwood trees. The soil is predominantly 
mineral sand which is generally deficient in nutrients due to natural leaching.
